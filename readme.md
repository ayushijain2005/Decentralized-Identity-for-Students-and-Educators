## Project Title
Decentralized Identity for Students and Educators

## Project Description
The "Decentralized Identity for Students and Educators" project leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform for students and educators to register and manage their educational identity. This smart contract ensures that users can securely register their details, including their name, role (student or educator), and institution. The records are immutable and verifiable on the blockchain, which provides transparency and eliminates the need for centralized identity management systems.

By using this platform, students and educators can maintain verifiable educational credentials, reducing the chances of fraud and simplifying the process of credential verification for universities, institutions, and employers.

## Project Vision
The vision of the project is to revolutionize the educational credential verification process by making it decentralized, transparent, and secure. By using blockchain technology, students and educators will have full ownership and control of their educational identity. This system will help eliminate identity fraud and the need for intermediaries when validating educational qualifications.

Key aspects of the vision include:
- Empowering students and educators with verifiable, tamper-proof digital identities.
- Providing a decentralized platform where educational institutions and employers can verify credentials easily and securely.
- Promoting transparency and trust in the educational sector.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Identity Registration**: Users (students and educators) can securely register their personal and educational details on the blockchain.
  
- **Immutable Records**: Once a user's identity and details are registered, they cannot be modified or tampered with, ensuring data integrity.

- **Role-Based Verification**: The contract ensures that the registered role of a user is either "Student" or "Educator", maintaining clarity and proper classification.

- **Transparency & Trust**: All actions and user registrations are logged on the blockchain, providing full transparency and auditable history for verification purposes.

- **Easy Access to User Information**: Anyone can verify a user's identity and details using the `getUserDetails` function, making credential verification easy and transparent for educational institutions and employers.

- **Low-Cost Verification**: Using blockchain technology reduces the costs and administrative burdens typically associated with credential verification, making it a cost-effective solution for educational institutions.
